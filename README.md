Muse-Glimmer-30B is a reproducible, self-hosted reference implementation of an
OpenAI-compatible inference gateway for the `Muse-Glimmer-30B` GGUF family on a
Kaggle notebook session with **two NVIDIA T4 GPUs (Kaggle "GPU T4 x2")**. It
combines a hardened loopback-only `llama-server` backend with DFlash2
speculative decoding and a Bearer-authenticated reverse proxy that exposes a
small, deterministic HTTP API.

## Overview

A complete serving stack for `Muse-Glimmer-30B` GGUF models:

- **Persistent loopback backend** — `llama-server` bound to `127.0.0.1:8088`,
  started and supervised by `./serve.sh`.
- **DFlash2 speculative decoding** — an attached 1.6 GB GGUF draft model
  accelerates generation; toggled with `SERVE_PROFILE=baseline` to disable.
- **Authenticated gateway** — `./expose.sh` runs `scripts/auth_proxy.py`, a
  loopback Bearer-auth proxy on `127.0.0.1:8090` that enforces a strict public
  contract and preserves SSE streaming.
- **One-command orchestration** — `./external.sh` drives backend readiness and
  exposure startup, status, endpoint discovery, and shutdown.

## Scope / What this is

- A **self-hosted reference implementation** and reproducible runbook.
- A **production-style demo** gateway: deterministic limits, single admission
  slot, token-bucket rate limiting, opaque request IDs, structured `muse_*`
  error envelopes, and streaming responses.
- Optimized for **user-owned compute**: you run it inside your own Kaggle
  notebook session with a "GPU T4 x2" accelerator and pay with your own quota.
- Community-reviewable: everything is deterministic and CPU-testable without a
  GPU (see [Reproducibility](#reproducibility)).

## What this is not

- Not a hosted/managed API service.
- Not covered by any SLA, HA promise, or uptime guarantee.
- Not an "enterprise production" platform.
- Not a model-training or fine-tuning toolkit.
- Not an introduction to `llama.cpp` or GGUF in general.

## Tested environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Platform | Kaggle GPU notebook session |
| Accelerator | NVIDIA T4 x2 (Kaggle "GPU T4 x2") |
| GPUs required | 2, each ≥ 14000 MiB VRAM (`GPU_REQUIRED_COUNT=2`, `GPU_MIN_VRAM_MIB=14000`) |
| CUDA devices | `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` |

## Architecture

```text
  client

    |  HTTPS (optional cloudflared quick/named tunnel)
    v

    |
    v
  GGUF target + DFlash2 draft (attached Kaggle inputs)
```

Controller entrypoints:

- `./serve.sh` — start / status / stop / restart the persistent backend.
- `./expose.sh` — start / status / stop the authenticated gateway (and
  optional cloudflared tunnel).
- `./external.sh` — one-command orchestration: `preflight`, `start`, `status`,
  `endpoint`, `local-endpoint`, `stop`, `stop-all`, with
  `--format text|env|json`.
- `./readiness.sh` — read-only fresh-notebook readiness probe.

## Requirements

- A Kaggle account and a notebook session with the **GPU T4 x2** accelerator.
- A `MUSE_API_TOKEN` of **at least 32 printable characters** (your own secret,
  used only by the gateway for Bearer auth).
- `cloudflared` on `PATH` when using quick/named public exposure
  (`EXPOSURE_MODE=quick` is the default).
- Attached Kaggle inputs (see [Model files](#model-files)).
- No GPU, tunnel, or model download is needed to run the deterministic test
  suite (see [Reproducibility](#reproducibility)).

## Model files

| Role | Filename | Size | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Target (primary) | `Muse-Glimmer-30B-Q4_K_M.gguf` | 17,306,324,000 B | `0d3fc85f61d10fdc84072f0bba6005d61c1ac5605a2627b0fd5ea4ff8194c384` |
| DFlash2 draft | `Muse-Glimmer-30B-DFlash2-Q4_K_M.gguf` | 1,645,657,280 B | `93dbfb6f88e4645dec1347cf93f9d6fc80b90d413038722385b2a8e53565c949` |

Expected placement (Kaggle inputs under `/kaggle/input`):

- Target model dataset: `bartowski-muse-glimmer-30b-gguf`
- DFlash2 draft dataset: `incoai-muse-glimmer-30b-dflash2-gguf`
- Prebuilt CUDA llama.cpp runtime dataset: `muse-glimmer-30b-dflash2-llama-runtime`

The backend reads the attached target model **in place** (no copy beside the
venv/lock state) and resolves the draft by exact filename inside the attached
input root. Serving is intentionally **exact**: verifiable-fallback model
substitution is disabled for the persistent server, and both model identities
are re-validated by size and SHA-256 before every start.

## Integrity / hash verification

Every `./serve.sh start` (and therefore every `./external.sh start`) verifies,
in strict mode:

1. `scripts/source_manifest.py check` — the source tree must match
   `SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256` (disable only with `SOURCE_INTEGRITY_MODE=warn|off`).
2. The exact pinned llama.cpp runtime commit and its verified manifest
   (`LLAMA_RUNTIME_MANIFEST_VERIFIED=1` for prebuilt runtimes).
3. Target model size and SHA-256 (`17306324000` /
   `0d3fc85f61d10fdc84072f0bba6005d61c1ac5605a2627b0fd5ea4ff8194c384`).
4. DFlash2 draft size and SHA-256 (`1645657280` /
   `93dbfb6f88e4645dec1347cf93f9d6fc80b90d413038722385b2a8e53565c949`).

Manual verification of the attached model files:

```bash
sha256sum /kaggle/input/bartowski-muse-glimmer-30b-gguf/*/Muse-Glimmer-30B-Q4_K_M.gguf
sha256sum /kaggle/input/incoai-muse-glimmer-30b-dflash2-gguf/*/Muse-Glimmer-30B-DFlash2-Q4_K_M.gguf
```

## Canonical production notebook

For a guided production-style Kaggle run, use [`notebooks/kaggle-production.ipynb`](notebooks/kaggle-production.ipynb).

The notebook validates the T4 x2 hardware gate, attached model/runtime inputs, frozen `v1.0.0` source identity, secure Bearer-token handling, real non-stream and SSE generation, optional Quick Tunnel transport, evidence, and cleanup.

See [`docs/KAGGLE_PRODUCTION.md`](docs/KAGGLE_PRODUCTION.md) for the operator contract and release qualification gates.

## Kaggle T4x2 quick start

```bash
# 1) Create a Kaggle notebook/session with the "GPU T4 x2" accelerator.
# 2) Attach the three Kaggle inputs from "Model files".
# 3) Clone this repository into /kaggle/working.

git clone https://github.com/dangkhoa2016/Muse-Glimmer-30B-GGUF-DFlash2-Kaggle-GPU-T4x2.git
cd Muse-Glimmer-30B-GGUF-DFlash2-Kaggle-GPU-T4x2

# 4) Verify the notebook is ready (read-only; no GPU/model required).
./readiness.sh

# 5) Set your gateway secret (>= 32 printable characters).
export MUSE_API_TOKEN='replace-with-a-secret-of-at-least-32-characters'

# 6) Validate external configuration without starting anything.
./external.sh preflight

# 7) Start backend + gateway + public tunnel (default EXPOSURE_MODE=quick).
./external.sh start

# 8) Print the public HTTPS endpoint.
./external.sh endpoint

# 9) Inspect combined backend/exposure status.
./external.sh status
```

The first start bootstraps a Python venv, resolves the pinned llama.cpp
runtime (attached prebuilt or source build), and prepares the exact model
state; it can take several minutes. Subsequent starts reuse ready state.

## Configuration

Defaults live in `config/default.env` and are overridden by environment
variables. Key knobs:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SERVE_PROFILE` | `dflash2` | `dflash2` enables DFlash2; `baseline` disables it |
| `SERVER_PORT` / `SERVER_HOST` | `8088` / `127.0.0.1` | Loopback backend bind |
| `EXPOSURE_PROXY_PORT` | `8090` | Loopback auth-gateway bind |
| `EXPOSURE_MODE` | `quick` | `quick`, `named`, or `proxy` (BYO tunnel) |
| `MUSE_API_TOKEN` | — | Bearer secret, ≥ 32 printable characters |
| `GPU_REQUIRED_COUNT` / `GPU_MIN_VRAM_MIB` | `2` / `14000` | GPU gate |
| `CONTEXT_SIZE` / `MAX_TOKENS` | `4096` / `256` | Generation window |
| `REASONING_STRENGTH` / `REASONING_BUDGET` | `low` / `64` | Chat reasoning budget |
| `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` | `3600` | Gateway request hard deadline (seconds) |
| `PROMPT_LIMIT` | `3` | Max chat messages per request |
| `SOURCE_INTEGRITY_MODE` | `strict` | `strict` / `warn` / `off` for the source manifest check |

Generation defaults: `TEMPERATURE=1.0`, `TOP_P=0.95`, `TOP_K=64`, `SEED=42`.
Do not change the canonical serving contract (loopback bind, layer split,
`PARALLEL_SLOTS=1`, draft `DFLASH_DRAFT_N_MAX=15`) — `serve.sh` fails fast if
it is violated.

## Backend startup

```bash
./serve.sh start      # start persistent llama-server on 127.0.0.1:8088
./serve.sh status     # machine-readable env blob (PROFILE/HOST/PORT/PROVENANCE/...)
./serve.sh restart
./serve.sh stop
```

The backend is loopback-only: `SERVER_HOST` must be `127.0.0.1` and
`SERVER_ALLOW_NONLOOPBACK` must be `0`. Externally reachable access is never
the server itself — it is always the authenticated gateway.

## Gateway startup

```bash
./expose.sh start     # start auth gateway (and tunnel in quick/named mode)
./expose.sh status
./expose.sh endpoint  # public HTTPS URL when a tunnel is up
./expose.sh stop
```

The gateway (`scripts/auth_proxy.py`) enforces:

- Bearer auth with `MUSE_API_TOKEN` for every protected endpoint;
- an endpoint allowlist (`GET /health`, `GET /ready`, `GET /v1/models`,
  `POST /v1/chat/completions`);
- a single admission slot and a token-bucket rate limit;
- request body size, message-count, and `max_tokens` validation;
- deterministic `muse_*` JSON error envelopes with opaque request IDs;
- SSE streaming pass-through with `[DONE]`.

For BYO transport, set `EXPOSURE_MODE=proxy` and terminate your own tunnel or
load balancer in front of `127.0.0.1:8090`; `./external.sh local-endpoint`
then prints the canonical local gateway URL.

## Readiness check

```bash
./readiness.sh                # default quick mode
./readiness.sh --mode quick   # source/config checks (no GPU/model needed)
./readiness.sh --mode proxy   # also requires EXPOSURE_MODE=proxy readiness
./readiness.sh --mode named   # also validates TUNNEL_TOKEN / EXPOSURE_PUBLIC_URL
./readiness.sh --format env   # machine-readable output
```

`./readiness.sh` is strictly read-only and never starts processes, loads
models, or consumes GPU compute.

## API usage

Base URL: the value of `./external.sh endpoint` (public) or
`./external.sh local-endpoint` (proxy mode, `http://127.0.0.1:8090`).

```bash
curl -sS https://<public-endpoint>/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MUSE_API_TOKEN"
```

```bash
curl -sS https://<public-endpoint>/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MUSE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "muse-glimmer-30B",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain this project in two sentences."}],
        "max_tokens": 256
      }'
```

### Example response (non-streaming)

```json
{
  "id": "muse-...",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "model": "muse-glimmer-30B",
  "choices": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "..." },
      "finish_reason": "stop"
    }
  ],
  "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 0 }
}
```

`GET /health` is public and reports gateway health; `GET /ready` is public,
probes the backend, and strips `Authorization` before contacting it.

## SSE example

```bash
curl -sSN https://<public-endpoint>/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $MUSE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "model": "muse-glimmer-30B",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count from 1 to 5."}],
        "stream": true
      }'
```

Streaming is preserved end-to-end: `text/event-stream` chunks carry
`choices[].delta.content`, the stream terminates with `data: [DONE]`, and
`finish_reason` (`stop`/`length`) is emitted before `[DONE]`.

## Busy/concurrency behavior

The demo accepts **one request at a time** (`PARALLEL_SLOTS=1`). While a
request is in flight you receive:

```text
HTTP/1.1 429
Retry-After: 5
```

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "muse_demo_busy",
    "message": "Another inference is in progress; the demo accepts one request at a time."
  }
}
```

Repeated admission is enforced by an exact slot lock and is covered by the
deterministic test suite. Rate limits, payload limits, and timeouts are also
enforced by the gateway before any request reaches the backend.

## Optional public tunnel

- `EXPOSURE_MODE=quick` (default) — `cloudflared` quick tunnel; print the URL
  with `./external.sh endpoint`.
- `EXPOSURE_MODE=named` — requires `TUNNEL_TOKEN` and a clean HTTPS
  `EXPOSURE_PUBLIC_URL` (Tunnel configuration).
- `EXPOSURE_MODE=proxy` — bring your own tunnel/LB; the gateway stays
  loopback-only on `127.0.0.1:8090` and `./external.sh local-endpoint` prints
  its URL.

Every public path is still Bearer-authenticated by the gateway; the tunnel is
transport only and never exposes `llama-server` directly.

## Shutdown / cleanup

```bash
./external.sh stop       # stop exposure (gateway/tunnel); keep the backend running
./external.sh stop-all   # stop exposure, then the owned backend
./expose.sh stop         # gateway/tunnel only
./serve.sh stop          # backend only
```

State and logs live under `artifacts/runtime-state/` (ignored by Git). To
fully reset a session, stop everything and delete `artifacts/` plus the
runtime dirs (`vendor/`, `models/`, `runs/`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `readiness.sh` reports `SOURCE_MANIFEST` blocker | Modify runtime files → rerun `bash scripts/source-manifest.sh write` to regenerate `SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256` |
| `preflight` fails on credentials | Set `MUSE_API_TOKEN` ≥ 32 printable chars; for `named`, also `TUNNEL_TOKEN`/`EXPOSURE_PUBLIC_URL` |
| `cloudflared` not found | Install it on `PATH`, or set `CLOUDFLARED_BIN` to an executable path |
| Backend fails identity checks | Attach the exact Kaggle inputs listed in [Model files](#model-files) |
| `429 muse_demo_busy` | A generation is already running; retry after the `Retry-After` window |
| First start is slow | Runtime bootstrap + model state preparation is one-time work |

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Highlights:

- The gateway **never** logs or persists bearer tokens, prompts, completions,
  reasoning, or raw request bodies; telemetry carries only counters.
- Models and runtime are pinned by SHA-256 / commit and re-verified on start.
- Loopback-only backend: external access is always through the authenticated
  gateway.
- A public tunnel publishes the gateway to the Internet — that is your
  responsibility as the operator, and you must protect your own token.

## Known limitations

- Single concurrent request (`PARALLEL_SLOTS=1`) by design.
- Requires exactly the tested hardware profile (`GPU T4 x2` on Kaggle,
  ≥ 14000 MiB per GPU).
- No multi-user tenant isolation; the gateway is a single-owner demo.
- No model fine-tuning, no training, no embedding endpoints.
- Pinned runtime/model identities are exact; free substitution is not
  supported by the persistent server.
- This is a reference implementation maintained on a best-effort community
  model, not a commercial service.

## Reproducibility

- **Frozen source:** every commit-tree is covered by `SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256`
  (see `scripts/source_manifest.py`); runtime integrity is enforced in strict
  mode at startup.
- **Deterministic tests (CPU-only, no GPU/model/tunnel/secrets):**
  `./demo-smoke.sh` drives the real gateway against a fake loopback backend
  and asserts the full public contract (auth, allowlist, forwarding, SSE,
  busy 429, rate limits, timeouts, telemetry, slot release). The CI pipeline
  runs it on every push/PR.
- **Pinned runtime:** llama.cpp commit
  `64f765f5adefa4620dddda436ce56f1430435536`, CUDA target sm_75.
- **Fresh clone** reproduces the exact contract without any model, GPU, or
  network access.
