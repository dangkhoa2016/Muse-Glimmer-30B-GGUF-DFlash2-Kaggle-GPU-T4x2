## [v1.0.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Self-hosted reference serving stack** for `Muse-Glimmer-30B` GGUF models
  on a Kaggle notebook session with two NVIDIA T4 GPUs (Kaggle "GPU T4 x2").
- **Persistent loopback backend:** `./serve.sh` starts, supervises, and stops a
  `llama-server` bound to `127.0.0.1:8088` with loopback-only enforcement,
  layer-split `1,1`, all layers on GPU, `PARALLEL_SLOTS=1`, and pinned model /
  runtime identity checks (size and SHA-256) before every start.
- **Authenticated gateway:** `./expose.sh` runs `scripts/auth_proxy.py` on
  `127.0.0.1:8090` with Bearer auth (`MUSE_API_TOKEN`, 32+ printable
  characters), a strict endpoint allowlist, single admission slot, token-bucket
  rate limiting, request validation, deterministic `muse_*` error envelopes
  with opaque request IDs, and SSE streaming preservation.
- **DFlash2 speculative decoding:** `SERVE_PROFILE=dflash2` (default) uses an
  exact pinned GGUF draft model; `SERVE_PROFILE=baseline` disables it.
- **One-command orchestration:** `./external.sh` provides `preflight`, `start`,
  `status`, `endpoint`, `local-endpoint`, `stop`, and `stop-all` with
  `--format text|env|json`.
- **Readiness probe:** `./readiness.sh` performs strictly read-only checks of
  source integrity, configuration, credentials, and external mode readiness
  without starting processes or consuming GPU compute.
- **Operator tooling:** `./doctor.sh` (machine-readable status authority),
  `./release-export.sh` (canonical release bundle export with verifiable
  source inventory), and `./package-llama-runtime.sh` (reproducible llama.cpp
  runtime packaging).
- **Source integrity contract:** `scripts/source_manifest.py check|write` and
  the committed `SOURCE_MANIFEST.sha256`; enforced in strict mode at backend
  startup (`SOURCE_INTEGRITY_MODE=strict|warn|off`).
- **Deterministic, CPU-only tests:** `./demo-smoke.sh` drives the real gateway
  against a fake loopback backend and asserts the full public contract (auth,
  allowlist, forwarding, SSE, busy 429, rate limits, timeouts, telemetry,
  slot release) with no model, GPU, tunnel, or network required.
- **Bilingual documentation:** English (`*.md`) and Vietnamese (`*.vi.md`)
  pairs for README, changelog, security, contributing, code of conduct, and
  support.
- **Community infrastructure:** `.github` issue templates, contribution
  guidelines, code of conduct, security policy, dependabot configuration, and
  a CI workflow that runs on `actions/checkout@v7` (and `actions/setup-python@v7`).

- **Canonical Kaggle production notebook:** a bilingual guided notebook validates the exact T4 x2 hardware, target/draft/runtime inputs, authenticated gateway, real non-stream and SSE generation, optional public transport, evidence, and cleanup.
- **Explicit public input identities and release packaging:** exact Kaggle resources/variations are linked, and the GitHub Release publishes deterministic source, notebook, evidence, and checksum assets.

### Key contract

- **API:** `GET /health`, `GET /ready`, `GET /v1/models`,
  `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI-compatible, SSE streaming supported).
- **Concurrency:** one request at a time; a busy gateway responds
  `429` with `Retry-After: 5` and a `muse_demo_busy` envelope.
- **Defaults:** `TEMPERATURE=1.0`, `TOP_P=0.95`, `TOP_K=64`, `SEED=42`,
  `CONTEXT_SIZE=4096`, `MAX_TOKENS=256`, `REASONING_STRENGTH=low`,
  `REASONING_BUDGET=64`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT=3600`, `PROMPT_LIMIT=3`.

### Security

- Gateway telemetry records counters only; bearer tokens, prompts,
  completions, reasoning, and raw bodies are never logged or persisted.
- The backend is loopback-only; external access always passes through the
  authenticated gateway.
- Model weights and the llama.cpp runtime are pinned by SHA-256 / commit and
  re-verified on every start.
- See `SECURITY.md` for supported version and responsible-disclosure details.

### Scope

- Reference implementation; users run the stack on their own Kaggle
  account/infrastructure and consume their own GPU quota.
- MIT license covers repository source and documentation only; model weights
  are third-party artifacts under their own upstream terms.
